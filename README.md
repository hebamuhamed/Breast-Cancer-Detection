Breast Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning
This project works on Mammogram images from the VinDr-Mammo dataset.
Multiple preprocessing techniques were applied and tested as using CLAHE, sharpening, etc which you will find done in the Preprocessing folder.
The VinDr-Mammoo dataset has its mammograms in the format of DICOM, DICOM can be used and could get better accuracies if used, the original dataset memory is 337.8 GB and for the purpose of this project, the dataset had to be converted to a JPEG format, as to take less space.
